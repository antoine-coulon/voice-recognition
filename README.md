# Keyword Voice Recognition

Project aiming to detect single word commands (for IoT purposes) based on Google's Speech Commands Dataset.
We only extracted 6 words (there are 30 in the dataset) from the dataset to lower the training time.

## Installation

Install Anaconda to embed all dependencies required.
Also, install PyAudio to submit a self recorded single word audio to be predicted by the model.

## About the dataset

The Google Speech Commands Dataset was created by the TensorFlow and AIY teams to showcase the speech recognition example using the TensorFlow API. The dataset has 65,000 clips of one-second-long duration. Each clip contains one of the 30 different words spoken by thousands of different subjects.
